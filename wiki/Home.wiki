=F1 Live-Timing for .NET=

This project provides a comprehensive library for reading messages generated by the official F1 live-timing [http://www.formula1.com/live_timing/ feed].

=Overview=

During each session of a race weekend the live-timing feed generates a stream of messages. Each message usually corresponds to an event that has taken place during the session, such as the track temperature increasing or a driver completing a lap, whilst other messages relate to the status of the session and feed. In all, messages fall into five categories:

|| *Category* || *Description* ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/ak-f1-timing/source/browse/trunk/src/AK.F1.Timing/src/Messages/Driver/ Driver] || Messages which relate to a single driver in the session, such as the driverâ€™s position, lap time, sector times and status. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/ak-f1-timing/source/browse/trunk/src/AK.F1.Timing/src/Messages/Driver/Feed Feed] || Messages which relate to the current status of the live-timing feed, such as keyframe number, validity and system messages. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/ak-f1-timing/source/browse/trunk/src/AK.F1.Timing/src/Messages/Driver/ Grid] || Messages which update the timing grid, such as setting the value and colour of a column or clearing a row.  ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/ak-f1-timing/source/browse/trunk/src/AK.F1.Timing/src/Messages/Session/ Session] || Message which relate to the current session, such as the session type, status and remaining time. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/ak-f1-timing/source/browse/trunk/src/AK.F1.Timing/src/Messages/Weather/ Weather]|| Messages which relate to the current climatic conditions, such as track / air temperate, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction. ||

The core library provided by this project allows you to easily read and consume these messages.
