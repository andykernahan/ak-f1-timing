This project provides a comprehensive library for reading messages generated by the official F1 live-timing [http://www.formula1.com/live_timing/ feed].

==Overview==

During each session of a race weekend the live-timing feed generates a stream of messages. Each message usually corresponds to an event that has taken place during the session, such as the track temperature increasing or a driver completing a lap, whilst other messages relate to the status of the session and feed. In all, messages fall into five categories:

|| *Category* || *Description* ||
|| Driver || Messages which relate to a single driver in the session, such as the driverâ€™s position, lap time, sector times and status. ||
|| Feed || Messages which relate to the current status of the live-timing feed, such as keyframe number, validity and system messages. ||
|| Grid || Messages which update the timing grid, such as setting the value and colour of a column or clearing a row.  ||
|| Session || Message which relate to the current session, such as the session type, status and remaining time. ||
|| Weather || Messages which relate to the current climatic conditions, such as track / air temperate, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction. ||
